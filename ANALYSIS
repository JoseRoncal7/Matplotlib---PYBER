ANALYSIS 

1. From the bubble graph we can conclude that there are more rides on the Urban areas rather than 
on the rural and suburban areas.

2. From the pie chart % of Total Fares by city Pie Chart, we can conclude that the majority of the 
fares obtained on the data are represented by the urban areas, which means that the people on the urban areas are the ones
using more this service.

3. Another conclusion that can be infered with this data is that the big majority of drivers are located in the urban areas with
more than 80%. This is because the demand for the service is bigger in those areas, so the supply of drivers has to be accordingly.
